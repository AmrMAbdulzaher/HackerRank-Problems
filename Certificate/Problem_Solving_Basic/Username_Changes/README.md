# HackerRank Problem: Usernames Changes

This repository contains a C/Python solution for the HackerRank problem "[Usernames-Changes] Challenge PS (Basic)" in the Problem Solving (Basic) track.

## Problem Description

The challenge involves analyzing an array of usernames and determining whether each username is eligible for a change based on certain conditions.

## Solution Explanation

The solution (`solution.c`) defines the function `possibleChanges` that takes an array of usernames and their count as input. It iterates through each username and determines whether it can be changed based on a specific condition.

The function allocates memory to store the result for each username, sets the result count, and then checks each username for eligibility. If a username is eligible for a change, it is marked as "YES"; otherwise, it's marked as "NO".
